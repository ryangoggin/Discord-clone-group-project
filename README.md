# PixelPal

PixelPal is a web application inspired by Discord that allows users to create servers where they can interact in real time with other users in their communities. This project aims to replicate Discord's ease of use and the ability to share content with other PixelPal clients running at the same time instantaneously through the use of WebSockets. PixelPal is built with a Python/Flask backend and a React/Redux frontend for responsiveness.
